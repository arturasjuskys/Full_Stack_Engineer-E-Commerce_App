# Portfolio Project: E-Commerce APP

## Overview
For this project, you will build an e-commerce application REST API using your knowledge of server-side web development. E-commerce applications are ubiquitous online and make up the back-bone of online business, making the skills used to build them invaluable for any budding entrepreneur or developer. This project requires that you build a fully-functioning e-commerce application REST API that allows users to perform various CRUD operations such as registering an account, browsing products for sale, etc.

### Project Objectives:
* Build a functioning e-commerce REST API using Express, Node.js, and Postgres
* Allow users to register and log in via the API
* Allow CRUD operations on products
* Allow CRUD operations on user accounts
* Allow CRUD operations on user carts
* Allow a user to place an order
* Allow CRUD operations on orders
* Use Git version control
* Use command line
* Develop locally on your computer
* Document the API using Swagger
* Deploy API live to Heroku

### Prerequisites:
* JavaScript
* Git and GitHub
* Command line
* Express
* PostgreSQL

## Going off platform
You will be doing this project outside of the Codecademy platform, on your own computer.

For this particular project, you will be using your own text editor (we suggest VSCode) and Git version control. If you need a refresher on how to work with Git for version control, [review the Git lesson](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) or look at this [cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf). You’ll also want to have [Node set up locally](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/setting-up-node-locally) to be able to run your application.

In addition, make sure you have [PostgreSQL installed locally](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path/tracks/fscp-postgresql-database/modules/fscp-setting-up-postgresql/articles/installing-and-using-postgresql-locally) as your database as well as the [Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) for deployment.

## Debugging Tips
Feeling stuck? Try the following:
* Google your question: oftentimes, someone has had the same question as you! Check out websites like StackOverflow and Dev.to to see how other folks have found solutions.
* Read the documentation: make sure to carefully read through the documentation for any languages and libraries that you are using. Often times they’ll have examples of what you’re looking for!
* Rubber ducking: try to explain a problem to a friend or co-worker. Oftentimes you’ll figure out the solution as you’re trying to explain it. And if not, getting another pair of eyes on your code can be helpful.
